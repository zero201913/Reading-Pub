South Africa: Healthy Eating and Non-Communicable Disease Prevention
南非：健康饮食与非传染性疾病预防

The food we eat has a *large impact*(很大影响) on our health. An *unhealthy diet*(不健康饮食) typically high in sugar, *saturated fat*(饱和脂肪), and salt and low in vegetables and fruits, can contribute to the development of *non-communicable diseases*(非传染性疾病). Examples of *NCDs*(非传染性疾病) are diabetes, *hypertension*(高血压), *heart disease*(心脏病) and cancer. There are highly *prevalent*(普遍的) in South Africa and as a disease group, have become the largest killer in the country.
我们吃的食物对健康影响很大。不健康的饮食通常糖分、饱和脂肪和盐含量高，而蔬菜水果含量低，会促进非传染性疾病的发生。非传染性疾病包括糖尿病、高血压、心脏病和癌症等。这些疾病在南非非常普遍，作为一类疾病，已成为该国最大的“杀手”。

One of things you can do to reduce the *risk*(风险) of developing NCDs is to eat a *nutritious diet*(营养均衡的饮食), ensuring that you include enough vegetables and fruits. The more *processed the foods*(加工食品) are in your diet, the farther away they are from their *natural state*(天然状态) and are more likely to contain added ingredients that in the *long run*(从长远来看) may be harmful to your health.
降低非传染性疾病风险的方法之一，是保持营养均衡的饮食，确保摄入足够的蔬菜水果。饮食中加工食品越多，它们离天然状态越远，也越可能含有添加成分，从长远来看可能对健康有害。

Eating healthy as a young person can be *challenging*(具有挑战性的). Some young advocates at *UNICEF's*(联合国儿童基金会的) youth advocacy trainings expressed they they often *skip breakfast*(不吃早餐) and rely on cheap, *fatty takeaways*(高脂肪的外卖) as a convenient option to keep them going *throughout the day*(一整天). There is also the *perception*(看法) that healthy foods are more expensive, and cooking healthy meals takes too much time. It's time to change this *narrative*(观念) and make healthy choices and a healthy diet more *affordable*(经济的) and *accessible*(容易获得的) for young people.
对年轻人来说，吃得健康并不容易。在联合国儿童基金会的青年倡导培训中，一些青年倡导者表示，他们经常不吃早餐，依赖便宜、高脂肪的外卖来“撑过一天”。还有一种看法是：健康食品更贵，而且做健康餐很花时间。现在是时候改变这种观念，让健康选择和健康饮食对年轻人来说更经济、更容易获得。

Other ways to *prevents*(预防) NCDs are being *physically active*(坚持身体活动) and limiting your intake of alcohol and tobacco. *Check out*(参考) the South African *Food-Based Dietary Guidelines*(食物类膳食指南) for helpful tips and suggestions on having a healthier diet. This version is *easy-to-digest*(通俗易懂的)!
