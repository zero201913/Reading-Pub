Ozone hole at record size, posing grave threats to Earth, humanity, scientist warns
臭氧空洞创历史新高，科学家警告对地球和人类构成严重威胁

‘We must remain vigilant and observe for a long time to ensure it will steadily recover in the long term,' says Parisa Ariya
“我们必须保持警惕并长期观察，确保它能在未来稳步恢复，”帕里萨·阿里亚说

The hole above the Earth’s *ozone layer*(臭氧层) on the Antarctic “will have adverse impacts on the planet and human life,” an expert told Anadolu as the hole is among the largest recorded, about three times the size of Brazil.
南极洲上空的臭氧层空洞“将对地球和人类生活产生不利影响”，一位专家告诉阿纳多卢通讯社，这个空洞是有记录以来最大的，约为巴西面积的三倍。
The ozone layer acts as a *natural shield*(天然屏障), efficiently filtering harmful solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet (UV) rays.
臭氧层就像一个天然屏障，有效过滤有害的太阳辐射，尤其是紫外线（UV）。

The hole's size variability is influenced by a strong wind band around Antarctica, a result of Earth's rotation and temperature differences. The band acts as a barrier, isolating air masses over polar latitudes.
臭氧层空洞的大小变化受南极洲周围强风带的影响，这是地球自转和温度差异的结果。这条风带就像一道屏障，将极地纬度上空的气团隔离开来。

Professor Parisa Ariya, an expert in chemistry and atmospheric and oceanic sciences at McGill University, told Anadolu how the substances catalytically destroy ozone, posing risks to human health and the environment.
麦吉尔大学化学和大气与海洋科学专家帕里萨·阿里亚教授告诉阿纳多卢通讯社，这些物质如何通过催化作用破坏臭氧，对人类健康和环境构成风险。

Ariya said human-made emitted gaseous and *halogenated molecules*(卤化分子) have caused a significant decrease in the ozone layer, “and thereby, the ozone layer's capability to filter the harsh radiation and expose us to stronger radiation with adverse health effects.”
阿里亚说，人类排放的气态和卤化分子导致臭氧层显著减少，“从而削弱了臭氧层过滤有害辐射的能力，使我们暴露在更强的辐射下，对健康产生不利影响。”

In 1987, two years after the discovery of the ozone layer, heads of state and government gathered to sign the *Montreal Protocol*(蒙特利尔议定书) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, banning the use of *chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)*(氯氟烃) -- chemicals that deplete the protective layer.
1987年，在臭氧层被发现两年后，各国国家元首和政府首脑齐聚一堂，签署了《关于消耗臭氧层物质的蒙特利尔议定书》，禁止使用氯氟烃（CFCs）——这种化学物质会消耗这一保护层。

Despite the signing of the Montreal Protocol, Ariya insists that vigilance and updated protocols are imperative.
尽管签署了《蒙特利尔议定书》，阿里亚坚持认为保持警惕和更新协议至关重要。

“We need to be more aware of these developments and have safeguards by evolving even further the original Montreal Protocol,” she said.
她说：“我们需要更了解这些发展，并通过进一步完善原始的《蒙特利尔议定书》来建立保障措施。”

Ozone, also identified as a “*greenhouse gas*(温室气体),” plays a crucial role in regulating climate by trapping heat, said Ariya.
阿里亚说，臭氧也被认定为“温室气体”，通过捕获热量在调节气候方面发挥着关键作用。

Scientific advancements, including satellite technology and spectrometers, enable accurate monitoring of ozone levels.
包括卫星技术和光谱仪在内的科学进步，使我们能够准确监测臭氧水平。

Ariya reported steady recovery trends but urged continuous vigilance and observation to ensure sustained progress.
阿里亚报告了稳步恢复的趋势，但敦促持续保持警惕和观察，以确保进展持续。

She emphasized that some of the halogenated compounds that are not yet banned and are used, for instance, in Asia, notably China, for agriculture and other purposes, are emitting and will have adverse effects on the planet and humans.
她强调，一些尚未被禁止的卤化化合物，例如在亚洲（尤其是中国）用于农业和其他目的的化合物，正在排放并将对地球和人类产生不利影响。

She stressed that several sustainable alternatives exist, however, vigilance is crucial to prevent the release of hazardous materials.
她强调，存在几种可持续的替代方案，但保持警惕对于防止有害物质的释放至关重要。
Ariya urged a drastic reduction in emissions affecting climate change, air quality and health.
阿里亚敦促大幅减少影响气候变化、空气质量和健康的排放。

To protect the ozone layer, Ariya urged targeted efforts in cities where a significant portion of pollutants is emitted. Advocacy for cleaner cities, sustainable transport and lifestyle changes are essential in reducing human effects.
为了保护臭氧层，阿里亚敦促在排放大量污染物的城市采取有针对性的措施。倡导更清洁的城市、可持续的交通方式和生活方式的改变，对于减少人类影响至关重要。

Ariya stressed the importance of long-term protection by bringing stakeholders together.
阿里亚强调，通过汇集利益相关者来实现长期保护的重要性。

“We must remain *vigilant*() and observe for a long time to ensure it will steadily recover in the long term,” she said. “We also have to adjust the regulation appropriately with the change of emitters and other processes that are linked to ozone transformation in the future.”
她说：“我们必须保持警惕并长期观察，确保它能在未来稳步恢复。我们还必须随着排放者的变化和未来与臭氧转化相关的其他过程，适当地调整监管。”
