WHY NOT ALL STEREOTYPES ARE BAD
并非所有刻板印象都是坏的

Using Generalizations to Help Make Better Decisions
利用概括来帮助做出更好的决策

We often speed through our fast-moving, complicated world using limited information to make tough decisions. But taking the right shortcuts isn't easy, said Dale Nance, JD, the John Homer Kapp Professor of Law at Case Western Reserve. In his new book—The Burdens of Proof: Discriminatory Power, Weight of Evidence, and Tenacity of Belief—Nance digs into complex decision-making in the midst of uncertainty. And in an undergraduate seminar he taught this year, Nance focused on the use of stereotypes in everything from regulating dangerous dogs to profiling potential terrorists. We asked him to explain the good and the bad of generalizations.
我们经常在这个快速发展、复杂多变的世界中，利用有限的信息做出艰难的决策。但凯斯西储大学法学教授戴尔·南斯（JD）表示，走对捷径并不容易。在他的新书《证明的负担：歧视性权力、证据权重和信念的韧性》中，南斯深入探讨了不确定性中的复杂决策过程。在今年教授的本科生研讨课上，南斯关注了刻板印象在从管制危险犬只到潜在恐怖分子侧写等各个领域的应用。我们请他解释概括的优缺点。

Many people shy away from the idea of making decisions based on stereotypes. Why? Stereotype has a negative connotation. But a stereotype is simply a generalization about how a group of people behaves. It may be statistically accurate but not universally valid. Many believe we shouldn't make decisions affecting an individual based on a stereotype, even if it is statistically accurate. Say a person wants to make a decision by relying on a generalization that "Children reared by single parents are more likely to be involved in criminal activity." Someone else may respond, "What about the single-parented children who don't fit this generalization?" It's one thing to challenge a generalization as inaccurate or to suggest a different generalization for use in the particular context. It's quite another to say we should ignore an accurate generalization just because there are exceptions to it. The real question is: What makes some uses of stereotypes inappropriate and others appropriate?
许多人回避基于刻板印象做决定的想法。为什么？因为刻板印象带有负面含义。但刻板印象不过是对一群人行为方式的概括。它可能在统计上是准确的，但并非普遍有效。许多人认为，我们不应该基于刻板印象做出影响个人的决定，即使它在统计上是准确的。假设有人想基于"单亲家庭长大的孩子更可能参与犯罪活动"这一概括做出决定。另一个人可能会回应："那些不符合这一概括的单亲家庭孩子呢？"质疑某一概括不准确，或者建议在特定情境中使用不同的概括，是一回事。仅仅因为存在例外就说我们应该忽略准确的概括，则是另一回事。真正的问题是：是什么让一些刻板印象的使用不恰当，而另一些恰当？

Age requirements. Most accept that a person should be a certain age to vote or drive a car. Neither is based on universally valid generalizations: Some 25-year-olds shouldn't be voting and some 16-year-olds would be competent to do so. Some 12-year-olds could reasonably drive a car. Nor is individual testing always a workable solution to such problems. Testing is expensive and not without its own errors and abuses. Imagine the controversies that would attend any individualized test for voter competence. Who would be trusted to design such a test? Even for something like driving skill, if we are confident that the vast majority of 12-year-olds would be poor drivers, is it worth the costs of giving all 12-year-olds the opportunity to take some test that most will fail?
年龄要求。大多数人都接受，一个人必须达到一定年龄才能投票或开车。这两者都不是基于普遍有效的概括：有些25岁的人不应该投票，而有些16岁的人则有能力这样做。有些12岁的孩子可以合理地开车。个人测试也不总是解决这类问题的可行方案。测试成本高昂，且并非没有自身的错误和滥用。想象一下，任何针对选民能力的个性化测试都会引发的争议。谁会被信任来设计这样的测试？即使是像驾驶技能这样的事情，如果我们确信绝大多数12岁的孩子会是糟糕的司机，那么让所有12岁的孩子有机会参加一个大多数人都会失败的测试，是否值得？

How, then, should we think about stereotypes?
那么，我们应该如何看待刻板印象？

First, it's naive to say you can't use a generalization about a class of people unless it's universally valid—we use such stereotypes all the time and would be paralyzed without them. Second, working out the ways in which the use of a stereotype can go wrong is important, as is determining when some alternative, like individualized testing, is appropriate. Many generalizations, like those based on race or gender or religion, are rightly subject to special scrutiny because of their historical misuse. But even here, it would be an error to say that use of a stereotype is 'wrong' just because there exist exceptions to the generalization upon which it is based.
首先，说除非概括对一类人普遍有效否则就不能使用它，这种说法是天真的——我们一直在使用这样的刻板印象，没有它们我们会陷入瘫痪。其次，找出使用刻板印象可能出错的方式很重要，确定何时采用替代方案（如个性化测试）是合适的也很重要。许多概括，如基于种族、性别或宗教的概括，由于其历史上的滥用，理所当然地受到特殊审查。但即使在这里，仅仅因为存在基于概括的例外就说使用刻板印象是'错误的'，也是错误的。
