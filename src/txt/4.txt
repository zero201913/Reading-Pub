China's BYD overtakes Tesla's electric car sales in the last quarter of 2023
中国比亚迪在2023年第四季度的电动汽车销量超过特斯拉

Chinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector.
2023年最后三个月，中国企业比亚迪售出的电动汽车数量超过了埃隆·马斯克旗下的特斯拉，两家公司正在争夺该领域的头把交椅。

BYD said on Monday it had sold a record 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the final quarter of 2023.
比亚迪周一表示，其在2023年第四季度售出了创纪录的52.6万辆纯电动汽车。

It marked the first quarter its battery-only sales have outpaced Tesla's. The US-based firm has seen demand slow as borrowing costs climb.
这是比亚迪纯电动汽车销量首次在单季度超过特斯拉。随着借贷成本上升，这家美国企业的需求出现放缓。

However, for the whole of 2023, Mr Musk's Tesla still sold more.
不过，就2023年全年而言，马斯克的特斯拉销量仍更高。

On Tuesday, Tesla said it delivered a record 484,500 electric vehicles in the last three months of 2023 and 1.8 million for the year as a whole.
特斯拉周二称，其2023年最后三个月交付了创纪录的48.45万辆电动汽车，全年交付量达180万辆。

The end-of-year performance was better than analysts had expected, as sales rose 20% from the same period in 2022 and picked up pace from earlier in 2023. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described the quarter as a "clear win" for Tesla.
年终表现好于分析师预期：销量较2022年同期增长20%，且较2023年初有所提速。韦德布什证券公司分析师丹·艾夫斯称，该季度对特斯拉而言是“明确的胜利”。

But it fell short of earlier hopes. Last January, Mr Musk said that Tesla had the potential to achieve two million deliveries in 2023.
但这仍未达到此前的预期。去年1月，马斯克曾表示，特斯拉2023年有望实现200万辆的交付量。

The firm cut prices repeatedly to try to woo buyers.
该公司多次降价以吸引消费者。

"As BYD has accelerated into the fast lane, it's fresh evidence of just how competitive the EV market has become and how hard it will be for Tesla to swerve back to head the pack," said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
“随着比亚迪驶入快车道，这再次证明电动汽车市场的竞争已变得多么激烈，而特斯拉要重新领跑将多么困难，”哈格里夫斯·兰斯当公司货币与市场部门负责人苏珊娜·斯特里特表示。

For the year as a whole, Shenzen-based BYD sold more than 3 million so-called-new energy vehicles (NEVs), which includes battery-only vehicles and hybrids.
就全年而言，总部位于深圳的比亚迪售出了超300万辆所谓的新能源汽车（包括纯电动汽车和混合动力汽车）。

Almost 1.6 million of its total sales were battery-only vehicles, the firm said.
该公司称，其总销量中近160万辆是纯电动汽车。

BYD's chief executive Wang Chuanfu co-founded BYD with his cousin in Shenzhen in 1995.
比亚迪首席执行官王传福于1995年与表兄在深圳共同创立了比亚迪。

The company made a name for itself as a manufacturer of rechargeable batteries - used in smartphones, laptops and other electronics - that competed with pricier Japanese imports.
该公司最初以可充电电池制造商的身份崭露头角（其电池用于智能手机、笔记本电脑等电子产品），与价格更高的日本进口电池展开竞争。

It started selling its shares on the stock market in 2002 and diversified by purchasing a struggling state-owned car manufacturer, Qinchuan Automobile Company.
比亚迪于2002年开始在股市上市，并通过收购陷入困境的国有汽车制造商秦川汽车公司实现业务多元化。

Since 2008 BYD has counted veteran US investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder.
自2008年起，比亚迪就将美国资深投资者沃伦·巴菲特旗下的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司列为股东。

Analysts say BYD owes its growth to its original business - batteries. They are among the most expensive parts of an EV and making them in-house saves BYD a lot of money.
分析师表示，比亚迪的增长得益于其原本的电池业务。电池是电动汽车成本最高的部件之一，自研电池为比亚迪节省了大量成本。

Many of BYD's competitors rely on third-party manufacturers for batteries.
比亚迪的许多竞争对手依赖第三方制造商供应电池。

BYD's battery business helped to give it flexibility to cut prices sharply at the end of 2023, lifting sales, which jumped by 70% in December alone.
比亚迪的电池业务使其在2023年底具备大幅降价的灵活性，从而拉动了销量——仅12月销量就激增了70%。
